Requirements: nodeJS, npm

Download the required dependencies:<br/>
`npm install`

The npm libraries (described in the package.json file) will be installed locally in your folder `node_modules`.
The npm libraries can also be installed globally (as maven does using the `.m2` folder).

Take a look at the `package.json` file that contains a script block.<br/>
Each script can be called with: `npm run` followed by the name of the script.

Check the code:<br/>
`npm run lint`

Run the tests:<br/>
`npm run test`

Measure the test coverage:<br/>
`npm run coverage`

Clean:<br/>
`npm run clean`

Run all the scripts:<br/>
`npm run all`
